Markov Chain State Simulation and Visualization
📌 Overview

This project implements and analyzes a discrete-time Markov chain to model stochastic transitions between a finite set of states. The system simulates state evolution over time using a predefined transition probability matrix and visualizes the resulting probabilistic dynamics using a directed weighted graph.

The project emphasizes both theoretical correctness and interpretability, combining probabilistic modeling with graph-based visualization techniques.

🎯 Objectives

Model a stochastic system using a discrete-time Markov chain

Define and validate a transition probability matrix

Simulate sequential state transitions under the Markov property

Analyze state visitation behavior over time

Visualize transition dynamics using graph representations

🧠 Theoretical Background

A Markov chain is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property, meaning that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

The dynamics of the system are fully characterized by a transition matrix 
𝑃
P, where each element:

𝑃

𝑗
=
𝑃
(

∣X

)

Each row of 
𝑃
P must sum to 1, ensuring valid probability distributions.

🏗️ System Design
State Space

A finite set of discrete states representing bus stops

Each state corresponds to a node in the Markov chain

Transition Model

Transitions between states are governed by a stochastic matrix

Probabilities are manually defined to reflect realistic movement patterns

Self-transitions and multi-directional transitions are supported

Simulation Process

Initialize the system in a chosen starting state

At each time step:

Sample the next state using the transition probabilities of the current state

Record the sequence of visited states

Repeat for a fixed number of steps
